Submit a message to the E-tivity 3: Matrices forum with a detailed description of how you have implemented the above described functionality and the name of your git branch. As part of this message, provide a worked out example of each of the operations detailed above applied to a 2x2 matrix of your choosing and verify that the results obtained with your functions are correct.

    "I will continue to use TDD as it worked well for me in Etivty2 to evolve the solution.\n",
    "I will use simple function calls to perform tests, rather than employ the full unittest framework\n",
    "I have a goal to exploit lambda functions if possible for simple functions where appropriate\n",

    "Assumptions:\n",
    "Matrices are valid i.e. each list entry represents a row, and each row will have the same number of elements\n",
    "I will dispense with a prettyprint function\n",

    "Iterations\n",
    "1. write matrix_get_size function\n",
    "2. write matrix_add function\n",

You will only need to test your code with the 2x2 matrix examples of your choosing (see Post) and with the 4x4 matrices provided to you by your peers (see Respond). GIT push the result to your remote branch and hand up your final code using the link in 'Uploads and Submissions' below.\n",

    "Feedback from Vipul:\n",
    "1. Assumptions of inputs are fine but in real world, the data does not always match the assumptions and its the validation code and the test cases which save the day. This is what I have faced more or less everyday. Hence I would beef up the code with more test cases which would test the corner cases for e.g. to sum and substraction of matrices - just a quick test to equate the sizes of the matrices - you have the function anyways to do that.\n",
    "2. In python we have the power and ability to loop directly over the items in a sequence and not use range(len(sequence)). This makes the code more readable. Have a look at https://python-forum.io/Thread-Basic-Never-use-for-i-in-range-len-sequence\n",
    "3. Your goal in the approach was to exploit the lambda functions - I would be happy to say that you are nearly there by passing the function as a parameter in your code, its similar to passing a function as a parameter to an higher order function\n",
    "4. def matrix_multiplication(matrix1, matrix2): I think the code to verify the compatibility of the matrices to do a multiplication is in the works and would be there in the final submission\n",
    "5. Also use the zip in order to extract the vector out of a matrix as detailed in one of my previous posts.\n",
    "6. After attending the online session with David, it was expected that the input matrix containers and the output would be tuples instead of list of lists - hence we need to change from lists to tuples.\n",
