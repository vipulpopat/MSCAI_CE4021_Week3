Submit a message to the E-tivity 3: Matrices forum with a detailed description of how you have implemented the above described functionality and the name of your git branch. As part of this message, provide a worked out example of each of the operations detailed above applied to a 2x2 matrix of your choosing and verify that the results obtained with your functions are correct. You may add these calculations to your post using the formula editor or as a scan of handwritten notes.\n",
