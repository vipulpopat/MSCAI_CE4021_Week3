# Week3
Purpose

The purpose of this E-tivity is to help you become confident with matrix addition, subtraction and multiplication and developing Python code to perform these operations.
Task (Complete by Wednesday)

Write Python functions for the following operations on matrices without making use of imported modules:

    Providing the size of a matrix as a 2-dimensional tuple
    Summing and subtracting two matrices
    Multiplying two matrices or a vector and a matrix of suitable size

GIT commit your tested code and push to your remote branch. Submit a message to the E-tivity 3: Matrices forum with a detailed description of how you have implemented the above described functionality and the name of your git branch. As part of this message, provide a worked out example of each of the operations detailed above applied to a 2x2 matrix of your choosing and verify that the results obtained with your functions are correct. You may add these calculations to your post using the formula editor or as a scan of handwritten notes.
Select (Complete by Thursday)

Choose the post of one of your peers and respond with a message indicating that you will critique their implementation. For this E-tivity, each participant’s code can only be reviewed by one peer and the first response to each post indicates who will be reviewing. You are of course free to provide any of your peers with helpful advice!
Respond (Complete by Saturday)

Having chosen your peer, git pull their branch and review their code. Provide a further response to your initial response in the E-tivity 3 forum with a respectful and in-depth assessment of the implementation with a view to pointing out potential improvements. If you feel your peer’s code cannot be improved, you may also provide suggestions for alternative solutions. As part of your response, provide calculations for the summing, subtracting and multiplication functions with 4x4 matrices of your choosing. Also provide one valid example of multiplication of a matrix and a vector. You may add these calculations to your post using the formula editor or as a scan of handwritten notes. 
Reflect (Complete by Monday Week 4)

Use the feedback provided to you, and any other insights you have gained since writing the original code to improve your code. GIT push the result to your remote branch and hand up your final code using the link in 'Uploads and Submissions' below.
